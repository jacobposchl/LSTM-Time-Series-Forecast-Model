# LSTM Time Series Forecasting Model ‚è≥

This project demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting time series data. The model predicts future values based on historical trends, making it ideal for tasks like stock price prediction or weather forecasting.

## Features
- Preprocessing of time series data (scaling, sequence generation).
- Implementation of an LSTM model using TensorFlow.
- Training and evaluation of the model on custom time series data.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LSTM-Time-Series-Forecast.git
   cd LSTM-Time-Series-Forecast
